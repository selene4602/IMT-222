# IMT-222
Code, libraries, etc
On the Guide Docs:
There are docs that help me to include libraries and change the path correctly. However, I made some changes related with my cubeMX initialization with the datasheet of the sensor DHT22 and configurating for smtL4 instead of smtF4.
On my own project:
There is all my project including libraries for smtL432KC, DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor, i2c (lcd16*2), and initialization with cubeMX for keil Vision 5.
Also I added the satasheet for DHT22 that I used for all the configuration.
Also here is a link that I used as my guide.
